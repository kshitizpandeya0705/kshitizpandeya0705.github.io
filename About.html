           "Hamro Tuition" is the home tuition class more specifically 'personal tuition'
            for students focusing class 1 to class 10 through the collaboration with few genuine 
            engineering students from Kantipur Engineering College. Analyzing the present Scenario, 
            we found out that students tend to learn and grasp the knowledge more effectively and efficiently
            with the tutors who are students themselves from the higher levels (like bachelors, masters persuing ).
            The learning students can get help from the tutors who can help them like their friends from their
            class but with better knowledge. With the help of our tutor team, students tend to feel less scared
            and more energetic to ask their problems leading to better quality tuitioning. Hence, we have come up
            with a team of good tutors who themselves have felt this during their school and can establish good 
            communication, friendly learning and teaching environment by both theoretical and practical skills 
            through this "Hamro Tuition" service. Lastly, our team consists of many girl tutors specifically to 
            girl students for their required comfortness. At the moment we are providing this service to more than 50+ 
            students from different part of kathmandu.
