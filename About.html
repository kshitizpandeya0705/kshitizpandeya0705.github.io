          <p>
            We have started "Hamro Tution" as collaborating with few classmates
            from Kantipur Engineering College. Analyzing the present Schenerio.
            We found that there is alot of generation gap between the Students
            and the Tutor due to which students are unable to express themselve
            with the tutors. To overcome this situation. We have build a team of
            tutors, who themselves have felt this generation gap and have exact
            solutions and can establish a good communication and friendly
            environment with students targeting their theoritical as well as
            practical knowledge developing skills.
